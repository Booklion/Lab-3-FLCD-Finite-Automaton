"""
    Lab 3 Statement:
    Write a program that reads the elements of a finite automaton from a file and:
    - Display set of states, alphabet, transitions, set of final states
    - Documentation should also include in BNF or EBNF format the form in which the FA.in file should be written
    - BONUS : Consider the input data corresponding to the lexical tokens of your programming language, verify if
      a given string is a valid lexical token.

        We will need to classify all the elements of an automaton
        Classes are: initial state (initialState), final states (finalStates), all the states we have (initial, final and intermediary) (states), transitions from one state to
        the other (transitions) and the alphabet (alphabet). They will be represented as lists.

            The left side of the transition is made out of 2 parts:
            1. The state itself, denoted by qi, with i=0,1,2
            2. The possible values it can take to reach the next state (this will make up the alphabet)
            The states enclosed between {} are the initial states
            The states enclosed between [] are intermediary states
